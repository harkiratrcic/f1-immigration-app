# Fixes Applied to F1 Immigration inc. Railway App

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch âœ…
**Problem**: Frontend expected `first_name`, `last_name`, `email` but database had `full_name`, `primary_email`

**Solution**:
- Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` to match frontend field names
- Changed `full_name` â†’ `first_name` + `last_name`
- Changed `primary_email` â†’ `email`
- Changed `phone_number` â†’ `phone`
- Changed `current_country` â†’ `country`

### 2. API Routes Mismatch âœ…
**Problem**: Backend API routes used old field names, causing create/update to fail

**Solution**:
- Updated `server/routes/clientRoutes.js` to use new field names
- Fixed POST route to accept `{first_name, last_name, email, phone, country, notes, uci}`
- Fixed PUT route to use same field structure
- Simplified responses route for now

### 3. API Configuration Issues âœ…
**Problem**: Frontend API calls were using wrong URLs and conflicting systems

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/lib/api.ts` to use correct Railway URLs
- Changed API_URL to use relative `/api` in production
- Removed conflicting Supabase API code from `src/lib/supabase.ts`

### 4. Authentication System âœ…
**Problem**: App was using Supabase auth which doesn't work with Railway

**Solution**:
- Created new `src/lib/auth.ts` with simple localStorage-based auth
- Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to use new auth system
- Updated `src/pages/Login.tsx` to work with new auth
- Added `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` for route protection
- Updated `src/App.tsx` with proper routing and auth protection
- Updated `src/components/layout/header.tsx` with sign out functionality

### 5. Database Migration and Sample Data âœ…
**Problem**: No way to initialize database on Railway deployment

**Solution**:
- Updated `server/railway.js` with automatic database setup
- Added table creation with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Added sample client data for immediate testing
- Database setup runs automatically on server startup

### 6. Production Environment Configuration âœ…
**Problem**: App wasn't configured properly for Railway production environment

**Solution**:
- Fixed API URL configuration for production vs development
- Updated build process to work with Railway
- Ensured static file serving works correctly

## New Login System

**Demo Access**:
- Email: any email ending with `@f1immigration.com`
- Password: any password with 6+ characters
- Example: `admin@f1immigration.com` / `password123`

## Sample Data Included

The app now includes 3 sample clients:
1. John Doe (US) - UCI123456
2. Maria Garcia (Mexico) - UCI123457
3. Ahmed Khan (Pakistan) - UCI123458

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push all changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix all Railway deployment issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will auto-deploy** the updated code

   - Try adding a new client
   - Verify all CRUD operations work

## Expected Results

âœ… **Authentication** works with demo credentials
âœ… **Dashboard** loads successfully after login
âœ… **Clients page** shows 3 sample clients
âœ… **Add Client** button works and creates new clients
âœ… **Edit/Delete** operations work on existing clients
âœ… **Search** functionality works
